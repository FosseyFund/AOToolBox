<p><strong><em>Animal Observer</em></strong> is an iOS application optimized for iPad and iPad mini. It allows users to collect behavioral data in the field or in captivity, but can also be used to record health data or any other individual-specific data. The current beta-version of <strong><em>Animal Observer</em></strong> is currently used by Fossey Fund scientists studying gorillas in Rwanda and Congo. The application will be made available to the public on the Apple Store in April 2015.</p>

<a id="current-features" class="anchor" href="#current-features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current features</h3>

<p><strong><em>Animal Observer</em></strong> is an iPad application specifically developed to help behavioral ecologist collect focal-follow and scan data on social animals. <strong><em>Animal Observer</em></strong> includes a default data collection protocol and a few gorilla group composition data which you can use to practice and evaluate whether the App meets your needs. Feel free to play with it and test the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>user-specific pin codes: if several users share the same device, you can give each of them a specific pin code. Default pin codes values range form 1111, 2222... etc to 7777.</li>
<li>after dialing your pin code the App starts a new session. On the first screen you can select session-specific variables. Default variable include the observer name and observer type. These variables can be modified and more variables can be added (see customizing tool below).</li>
<li>select the social group you want to study during the session. Double tap on the images to zoom in. Add additional individuals using the + button at the end of the image list.</li>
<li>GPS feature: if GPS is turned on, the App will record a GPS coordinate (lat, lon, alt, precision)  each time a new behavior is recorded, each time a scan is recorded and each time a text comment is entered. If you use the App in the field, we recommend pairing the iPad with a bluetooth GPS. Several models exist. We currently use the Garmin GLO with success.</li>
<li>Use Compass: if you turn this feature on, you will be able to enter the compass bearing of the focal individual at the end of each scan. Combined with the GPS data, this feature can be used to calculate the lat/lon coordinate of all the individuals you are observing. This type of data can then be used to study individual movement patterns (who is at the front of the group, who walks behind...etc).</li>
<li>Map mode: in this mode, the typical background (target with circles at 2m, 5m, 10m, 20m... etc) is replaced by an image in png format. If this image is a map of a small study area (eg, forest clearing visited by gorillas, enclosure in a sanctuary or a zoo), you will be able to use your scan data to look at which areas of your map are used the most (or the least) by your study individuals or groups.</li>
<li>the data upload/download button also offers a few features, the most important being "delete all behavior data"...</li>
<li>press "confirm settings" and access the focal settings. Select an individual, a focal duration and a scan interval.</li>
<li>if you want to enter focal-specific variable, it's possible. The default version only has one such variable (Data usage) but this can be customized.</li>
<li>press "Start Focal" and proceed with the first scan. Drag individuals from the left panel to the scene and place them wherever you see them around the focal individual. Tap on the individuals you want to record activities for. To select several individuals at the same time, double tap on the scene and draw a circle around these individuals BEFORE your second tap looses contact with the screen. This gesture may require a little bit of practice...</li>
<li>Enter scan-specific variables on the bottom left panel and finish your scan. If Compass is on, you can then enter the bearing of the focal individual.</li>
<li>During the time until the next scan, you can enter social behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
